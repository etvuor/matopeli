I only have one of my university data science porjects I did for school this was the last course so it was quite large project and we did it 3 parts so that's why it kind of resets in the beginning of each, so I try to create a couple of new ones to show case my skills nothing too crazy but basic things that I can build fast, the project was a bigger one
